What is a variable?

A variable is an *address* of a memory location.  *In computer science, it* is NOT an undefined term to solve for. This is fundamentally different than algebra.

In data science a variable refers to what something is, in algebra a variable is a stand in for what something could be. 

For data science:
 
 x = df.colums[1]
 
 The first column in the data frame (the code) are now saved in a location titled x
 
For algebra, 

x = 2 + 3y

X is a set of possible values that can exist based on the value of y.
