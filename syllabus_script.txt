Hi Everyone,

Welcome to Data Storytelling in R.  I'm your instructor Dan Maxwell.

In this short video, I want to take a few minutes to highlight a few items in the class syllabus.  Please note: this video is not a substitute for reading the syllabus as it contains additional information you need to know to succeed in this class.

So here are a few points to keep in mind as you review the syllabus.

First -- my office hours are Wednesday's from 2 to 5 pm.  You can find me in the Marston Science Library, Room L301E.  If you have trouble finding my office, ask anyone at the front desk and they will direct you to it.

Second -- there is a required text for this class, a custom textbook that can be purchased from Cengage Learning. There is a recommended text as well-- R in Action by Robert Kabacoff.  I highly recommend Kabacoff's book, especially if you plan to use R in future work.  This book provides a solid overview of the language and is a wonderful reference text.

Third -- please read the course goals and objectives as this is a concise statement of what you'll learn in this class.

Fourth -- pay close attention to the due dates of the assignments.  As noted in the syllabus, late work is not accepted and will receive 0 points.  So be sure to have your assignments turned in before midnight on the day it is due.

Fifth -- you will take 4 quizzes in this class, each worth 10 points.  Quizzes cover the assigned readings from the textbook.  The good news is that the quizzes are NOT timed, and you can take each one up to three times...

Sixth -- you also have 4 coding assignments, each worth 15 points.  Please use the template provided in the syllabus.  And remember, you must also provide console output for the code you write for each question.  I also encourage you to write and run all example code found in the worksheets.  Don't copy and paste the code.  Type it in.  For when you type code, you'll inevitably make mistakes and this is a good thing because fixing problems is how you learn to program!

I also want to point out that the class has about 25 videos you can watch, on a variety of R programming topics.  As you work on the coding assignments, I encourage you to check these out.  A link to the R Drive-In – as I call it – can be found at the bottom of each module, in the Movie Plex section.

And finally, carefully read the Data Story Presentation section as this assignment is worth 100 points -- half the total points for the class!  With this assignment, you can work together in groups, but each person must create their own presentation.  A team, for example, might decide to use a common dataset, with each member telling part of the data story.  
Please read and understand the Data Story Presentation Rubric as that will be used to determine your grade in this final assignment.  I’ll have much more to say about this presentation as we move into the semester.  So stay tuned!

I hope you enjoy this learning experience.
