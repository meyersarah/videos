#### Best-Practices -- Cardinal Sins

Have a designated home for each project. For most data science projects, that home will be Github

For projects that have HIPAA restrictions, designate a secure directory where files are stored and accessed. 

When you set up a directory always follow the same format.
	Always have a fig, data, and doc directory
	Sometimes have archive directory
	Underscore indicates this is a project specific activity
	License and ReadMe

(_project_title)
	data 
	fig
	doc
	Archive
	LICENSE
	README
	(_project_component_1)
	(_project_component_2)
	(etc)
	
Rules
Never have duplicate datasets
Always keep it clean
Mimic your local directory structure to your cloud directory
Process is ongoing in keeping the repository clean
Donâ€™t let junk pile up around you
Consistency, consistency, consistency
Same kind of logic used across the board
Everything in its place, only keep what you need

The goal is to avoid problems related to mistakes in organization
