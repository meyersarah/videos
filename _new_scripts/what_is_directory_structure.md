In computing, a directory structure is the way an operating system's file system and its files are displayed to the user. Files are typically displayed in a hierarchical tree structure.  The root directory lies at the base of the tree.

Directories are places where you store your data, files, and folders. 

Having a clean directory allows you to easy access your data in your code. 
You can save your directory locally or work on a cloud based directory like Github 

Github

Using Github

You create your own repository (direcotry) or "fork" another's repository
You can then make changes to that repository as much as you like
You can select which chnages you want to then suggest be reconciled with the original repository
To do that you would create a "pull request"
The owner would approve or reject the pull
All the differences would be integrated into the master repository
